# Gluteboy.com

Created a joking little site for a few reasons:
1) gluteboy.com was available
2) I wanted to learn SvelteKit
3) My friend thought it was hilarious.

## Tech Stack Used
- SvelteKit
- TailwindCSS
- Vercel (hosting & deployments)
- Cloudflare (DNS)

## Future Features
- "Join the Glute Army" -- ability to join and have your very own glute exercises appear.
- Comments appear under each activity
- Clean up the display of activities / render only when activities have loaded
- Caching mechanism to reduce # of calls to Strava API.
